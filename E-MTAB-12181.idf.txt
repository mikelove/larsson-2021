Protocol Description	Skin tissue was dissected from 9 week old female F1 offspring of matings between CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice. Cells were dissociated from skin as described in Joost et al., or using GentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec); with both methods giving similar cell yields and viability. Briefly, for the GentleMACS method, dorsal skin was cut and minced into small pieces (approximately 1x1mm) and incubated in HBSS (Sigma) + 0.04% BSA (Sigma) + 0.2% Collagenase Ia (Sigma) at 37째C for 60 minutes with occasional agitation. Thereafter this slurry was processed on a GentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) with 2x Program D, cell-strained (70um) and washed. Residual tissue was further treated with HBSS + 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) at 37째C for 15 minutes and processed likewise. For the Joost et al method, GentleMACS dissociation was substituted with manual disaggregation by smashing tissue fragments against a cell strainer with the piston from a 5 mL syringe	Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 per the manufacturer's protocol.	Cells were subjected to the Smart-seq2 protocol with no modification.	Cell lysis during sorting by FACS.
